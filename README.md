# Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) System üîê

## Project Overview
- Implements **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** using **Nodemailer** for enhanced security.  
- Users receive a **verification code** via email during registration, which must be **verified** to complete the process.  

## Key Features
- **Secure Authentication**: Ensures user identity verification before granting access.  
- **Email Verification**: Sends a unique **OTP (One-Time Password)** using **Nodemailer**.  
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with **React.js** for the frontend and **Node.js (Express.js)** for the backend.  
- **MongoDB Atlas Database**: Stores user credentials securely.

# Components to Include  

## User Registration & Authentication
- Users **sign up** with their email and receive a **verification code**.  
- The **OTP must be validated** before the registration is completed.  
- After verification, users can log in securely.  
-  **Google OAuth** for social login support.
-  
## Backend Development (Node.js & Express.js)
- Uses **Express.js** to handle API routes for authentication.  
- Integrates **Nodemailer** to send OTPs via email.  
- Encrypts user credentials for added security.  

## Frontend Development (React.js)
- Built with **React.js** for a smooth and interactive user experience.  
- Uses **state management** to handle form inputs and responses dynamically.  

## Database (MongoDB Atlas)
- Stores **user data** securely using **MongoDB Atlas**.  
- Ensures data integrity with proper validation and encryption techniques.  

## Security Enhancements
- Implements **bcrypt.js** for password hashing.  
- Uses **JWT (JSON Web Token)** for secure user authentication.  
- Prevents unauthorized access with **middleware authentication**.  

---

# Deployment & Hosting
- it deployed on **Vercel with frontend hosting and backend hosting.  
 

## Future Enhancements
- Implement **SMS-based OTP verification**.  
- Add **multi-user roles** with different authentication levels.
